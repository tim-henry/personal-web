This index.html was placed in your home directory when your account
was created.  Without this file, anyone accessing your home directory
on the web would see a listing of your files, but would NOT be able to
access their contents.

If you choose to create a website on Athena, you'll need to put its
contents in the "www" subdirectory in your account, and give out a URL
including the "www" directory.  For example, if your username is
"joeuser", you should give out the following URL to anyone wishing to
visit your website: http://web.mit.edu/joeuser/www/

Before creating a website or removing this file, we strongly encourage
you to read up on AFS Permissions in our knowledge base at
http://kb.mit.edu.
